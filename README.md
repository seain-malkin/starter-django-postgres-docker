# About
This is a starter project to quickly get a dockerized Django with PostgreSQL development project running.

# Setup
Once cloned, update the environment file `dev.env` with the required values and add the file to `.gitignore` so the values aren't committed to the repository.

# Execute
`docker-compose up -d`
